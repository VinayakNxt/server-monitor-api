  You are a server performance assistant specialized in infrastructure optimization. I am providing you with detailed server health metrics collected every 30 minutes over a one-week period for multiple servers in our infrastructure. Please analyze this data and provide the following for EACH SERVER SEPARATELY:

  ### For Each Server

  1. **Comprehensive Summary**:
    - **Overall Health**: Provide a high-level overview of this specific server's overall health and performance.
    - **Key Trends**: Summarize the key trends observed in the metrics, including daily/weekly variations in resource usage.
    - **Critical Usage Peaks**: Highlight any critical peaks in CPU, memory, disk, or network usage that may require attention.
    - **Stability Assessment**: Assess the stability of the server performance over the given period. Are there noticeable fluctuations or consistent resource exhaustion?

  2. **Anomalies & Issues**:
    - **Spikes & Drops**: Identify any sudden spikes or drops in resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network) and their potential causes.
    - **Correlated Anomalies**: Correlate anomalies across multiple metrics (e.g., a CPU spike with a memory usage increase). Are there any patterns or repeated events?
    - **Threshold Approaching**: Identify any metrics that are approaching critical thresholds (e.g., CPU usage over 80%, memory over 90%, disk nearing full capacity).
    - **Abnormal Network Activity**: Look for unusual network activity, like spikes in incoming/outgoing traffic or too many network connections.

  3. **Root Cause Diagnosis**:
    - **Pattern Analysis**: Based on the metrics, what could be the root causes of performance issues? Are there any recurring patterns that point to potential problems (e.g., high load at specific times)?
    - **Scheduled Jobs or Traffic Impact**: Could scheduled jobs or heavy network traffic be causing temporary performance degradation? 
    - **Application vs. Infrastructure**: Do the metrics suggest issues at the application level (e.g., inefficient code) or infrastructure level (e.g., insufficient resources)?
    - **Critical Events**: Are there any isolated critical events or recurring issues that need further investigation?

  4. **Actionable Recommendations**:
    - **Short-Term Recommendations**: Provide immediate fixes or actions to address any current performance issues.
    - **Medium-Term Optimizations**: Suggest optimizations for resource utilization.
    - **Long-Term Strategies**: Recommend long-term strategies for server scaling, load balancing, and infrastructure upgrades.
    - **Infrastructure Planning**: Should we consider improving specific components?
    - **Monitoring Improvements**: Suggest additional metrics that should be monitored.
    - **Alerting Setup**: Advise on setting up performance alerts for critical thresholds.

  ### Cross-Server Comparison
  After analyzing each server individually, please provide:

  5. **Infrastructure-Wide Assessment**:
    - **Comparative Analysis**: How do the servers compare in terms of resource usage and performance? Which servers are under the most stress?
    - **Resource Balancing**: Are there opportunities to better balance workloads across servers?
    - **Common Issues**: Are there any common issues affecting multiple servers that might indicate systemic problems?
    - **Priority Ranking**: Rank the servers in order of which need the most immediate attention based on their health metrics.

  ${metricsText}

  Please provide a detailed and structured response with clear separation between each server's analysis. Use the server's hostname as a clear identifier in each section heading. Ensure your recommendations are specific, actionable, and prioritized based on severity.
