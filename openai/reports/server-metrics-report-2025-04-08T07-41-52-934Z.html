## Server: ubuntu-s-2vcpu-4gb-amd-blr1-01

### 1. Comprehensive Summary
- **Overall Health**: The server exhibits stable performance with low CPU usage and moderate memory usage. Disk utilization remains well within safe parameters.
- **Key Trends**: CPU usage varies between 1.77% to 2.67%, while memory usage fluctuates but remains around 54-55%. Network traffic shows variability with peaks, especially RX rates.
- **Critical Usage Peaks**: The CPU usage peaks are minimal, with the highest recorded at 2.67%. Memory usage occasionally touches 55.69%, but this is not critical. Disk usage remains at 36%, far from full.
- **Stability Assessment**: Overall, the server shows consistent stability with minor fluctuations in resource usage, indicating no severe performance concerns.

### 2. Anomalies & Issues
- **Spikes & Drops**: There are occasional spikes in CPU usage, particularly around the timestamps 14:19:22 and 14:41:12, but they are brief and do not indicate sustained load.
- **Correlated Anomalies**: Network RX and TX rates have shown correlation with CPU load increases during specific timestamps, suggesting heavy traffic during those periods may coincide with increased processing.
- **Threshold Approaching**: Memory usage is nearing 55% but is not critically high. Disk usage remains stable at 36%.
- **Abnormal Network Activity**: Network RX bytes occasionally spike significantly, notably at 14:03:14 which may indicate bursts of incoming traffic.

### 3. Root Cause Diagnosis
- **Pattern Analysis**: The patterns indicate that peak CPU usage often correlates with spikes in network traffic. These may be due to incoming requests or data processing tasks.
- **Scheduled Jobs or Traffic Impact**: The server may have scheduled jobs or backups that coincide with network traffic peaks, impacting CPU load temporarily.
- **Application vs. Infrastructure**: The metrics suggest no immediate application inefficiencies; the infrastructure seems adequately provisioned.
- **Critical Events**: No isolated critical events were noted; performance concerns appear to be transient and related to traffic patterns.

### 4. Actionable Recommendations
- **Short-Term Recommendations**: Monitor the server during peak traffic times; if CPU spikes become sustained, consider scaling resources.
- **Medium-Term Optimizations**: Implement load balancing for incoming traffic to distribute the load evenly across the infrastructure.
- **Long-Term Strategies**: Consider upgrading to higher CPU capacity instances if traffic growth is projected.
- **Infrastructure Planning**: No immediate infrastructure improvements are required, but keep monitoring disk usage trends.
- **Monitoring Improvements**: Introduce alerts for CPU load above 80% and memory usage above 75%.
- **Alerting Setup**: Set up performance alerts for critical thresholds to proactively manage resource usage.

---

### Cross-Server Comparison
**Infrastructure-Wide Assessment**
- **Comparative Analysis**: The analyzed server shows stable usage compared to other instances. No immediate overloads were detected.
- **Resource Balancing**: Given the low resource utilization, there are opportunities to offload tasks from other servers if needed.
- **Common Issues**: No common issues across servers were identified; each server appears to operate independently within acceptable parameters.
- **Priority Ranking**: This server ranks low on the priority list for immediate attention, indicating minimal action required.

This detailed analysis serves as a baseline for ongoing performance monitoring and optimization efforts. As traffic patterns evolve, continuous assessment will ensure readiness to address potential issues proactively.</pre>
